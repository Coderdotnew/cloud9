# Cloud9 Tutorial
Before we start our journey towards becoming a great programmer, we must first set up our Cloud9 accounts. Cloud9 is a coding environment that allows us to run code files, and to create projects in many different programming languages. 

First, go to www.c9.io . You should have already set up your account, so we're going to jump right into setting up your workspace. Right in the middle of the screen you're going to see a huge grey button that looks like this:

Click it.

It will take you to another screen. You're going to name your Workspace "intro_web_apps" and Describe it as: "(Your name)'s Coder.new coding challenges" as see in the example. The HTML5 template at the bottom should be selected as well. Now we're ready! Create your workspace!

Okay. first things first, we have to delete the files they created for us (They are assuming we want to write in HTML, but we'll be doing most of our work in ruby as an ".rb" file). So, go to the top left corner where you see the "hello-world.html" and "README.md" files, select both of them, and delete them. You can also go on the main screen and click the delete tab on the readme that's open so we have a nice clean slate for us to work on.

Cool. Let's take a look around...

Wait...what! Why is the example's Cloud9 black/look infinitely cooler than mine?????? We just customized ours to look like this. You're going to be working in this environment A LOT so we might as well make it look cool, right? You can give your environment a little flare and make it look not-lame by following these instructions: (https://docs.c9.io/docs/terminal)


Okay back on track...First, take a gander at the top half. The highlighted areea is where you are going to be writing code, interpreting Spec files, and building apps! We'll get into how to run code files soon...

Moving on...Look below. Do you see the highlighted area/where the arrow is pointing? This is called your terminal. Your terminal is where you'll be navigating through your files, creating files, running files, etc. So why don't we give it a whirl!

Lets create some folders in our **file tree**. Click on your terminal, and type in "mkdir 01_challenges" as seen here:

Click enter. What you just did was make your first folder or "Directory"! 

(**M**a**K**e **DIR**ectory. get it?)

But hey, let's not stop there. Let's make diriectories for all of our coding challenges we'll be doing throughout the course. Stay in your terminal and do essentially what you did 10 times, but change the challenge number each time.

Good work. Now let's look at the top left at your **file tree**. Your file tree is an organizational tool that you use to keep your files in a nice, neat order so you can find them when you need to. Should look something like this:

Done! So, now what? feel free to poke around a little bit and get used to this environment because you'll be staring at it for the next couple weeks (and hopefully many weeks and years after that).
